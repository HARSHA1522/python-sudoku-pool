## These are a few repositories that I found useful. Hope youâ€™ll like them
>***For my personal favourites, look out for one of these :+1:*** 

## 1. CNN + Backtracking :+1:
[link](https://github.com/AliShazly/sudoku-py)

This is one of my personal favourites. Everything is explained in detail and the codes are easy to use. Check out this repo for an easy hands-on experience. 

__Features__:

- Training a Keras CNN to recognize digits (dataset included)

- Pretrained - model included

- Sudoku solved using Backtracking

__Format__ : Image, Live Cam

__Limitations__:
- Webcam solver cannot detect when a new puzzle has entered the frame, will try to warp the solution of the first puzzle it sees onto any subsequent puzzles

- OCR predictions are very spotty for hand written digits and stylized fonts

- Cannot solve puzzles that don't have a distinguishable four-point outer border

## 2. CNN + MNIST + Backtracking
[link](https://github.com/Pydare/Sudoku-Game-Solver)

__Features__:

- Training a Keras CNN model to recognize digits

- Keras MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

- Pretrained - model included

- Sudoku solved using Backtracking

__Format__ : Image, Live Cam

__Limitations__: 
OS : Ubuntu, Windows

## 3. Tesseract + python-constraint
[link](https://github.com/tfeldmann/Sudoku)

__Features__:

- This uses Tesseract for OCR

- Sudoku solved using the python-constraint library

__Format__ : Live Cam

__Limitations__: 
OS : mac OS, Windows

## 4. Just Logic :+1:
[link](https://github.com/aaronfrederick/SudokuSolver)

This repo is very impressive. Check out his [Blog](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/solving-sudoku-in-seconds-or-less-with-python-1c21f10117d6)!! This explains the logic behind the scripts.

__Features__:

- OCR to recognize digits

- Unlike other approaches which use Deep Neural Networks, he uses mere logic and data structures to  solve sudoku

- And it's pretty fast!!
